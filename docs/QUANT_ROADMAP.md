## Key Development Principles

### üéØ Engine-First Approach
1. **No strategy development without validated backtesting engine**
2. **Engine validation gates**: Performance benchmarks, accuracy tests, stress tests
3. **Dual-engine strategy**: vectorbt for research speed, custom for production accuracy
4. **Continuous validation**: Automated testing and performance monitoring

### Quality Gates

| Phase | Gate Criteria | Blocker |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Phase 1 | All engine tests passing, <30s custom, <1s vectorbt | Yes |
| Phase 2 | Database migration complete, query <1s | No |
| Phase 4 | Factor library validated using engine | Yes |
| Phase 7 | Strategies >100 trades, Sharpe >1.0 | Yes |
| Phase 11 | Full integration test passing | Yes |
