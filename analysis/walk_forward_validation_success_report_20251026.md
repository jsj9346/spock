## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Walk-Forward Period Generation
```python
# Configuration
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2025-06-30'
train_years = 1
test_years = 1

# Generated Periods
Period 1: Train(2022-2023) → Test(2023)
Period 2: Train(2023-2024) → Test(2024)
```

### Factor Configuration
**Tier 3 Strategy**:
1. **Operating_Profit_Margin**: Profitability factor
   - Formula: Operating Profit / Revenue
   - Signal: Higher is better

2. **RSI_Momentum**: Technical momentum indicator
   - Formula: RSI(14) relative strength index
   - Signal: Moderate RSI (30-70) preferred

3. **ROE_Proxy**: Return on Equity approximation
   - Formula: Net Income / Total Equity (or Shareholders' Equity)
   - Signal: Higher ROE indicates better capital efficiency

### Backtest Parameters
```
Initial Capital:     ₩100,000,000
Stock Selection:     Top 45th percentile
Rebalance Frequency: Quarterly (Q)
IC Window:           252 days (rolling 12-month)
IC Weighting:        Signed IC (exclude negative IC factors)
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Metric Parsing Issues

**Problem**: Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown parsed as 0.0

**Root Cause**:
- `walk_forward_validation.py` parses backtest output using regex patterns
- Output format from `backtest_orthogonal_factors.py` may have changed
- Parsing logic expects specific format: "Sharpe Ratio: X.XX"

**Evidence**:
```csv
# walk_forward_results_20251026_112705.csv
period,return,sharpe,max_drawdown
1,7.11,0.0,0.0
2,-0.15,0.0,0.0
```

**Impact**:
- Cannot assess risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Cannot evaluate drawdown risk
- Production readiness check unreliable (2/5 criteria unknown)

**Mitigation**:
- Returns and Win Rates are correctly parsed and reliable
- Transaction costs are correctly calculated
- Manual backtest re-run can extract missing metrics

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Review `backtest_orthogonal_factors.py` output format
2. Update parsing regex in `walk_forward_validation.py` lines 174-180
3. Re-run validation to capture Sharpe and Max DD

### 2. Limited Historical Data

**DART API Constraint**: Fundamental data only available from 2022-12-31 onwards

**Impact**:
- Only 2.5 years of data available (2022-2025 Q2)
- Only 2 walk-forward periods possible
- Limited statistical significance (small sample size)

**Comparison to Best Practices**:
- Industry standard: 5-10 years of backtest data
- Minimum recommended: 3-5 years with 5+ walk-forward periods
- Current: 2.5 years with 2 walk-forward periods

**Implications**:
- Results may not capture full market cycle
- Strategy robustness not fully tested
- Overfitting risk remains (need more out-of-sample tests)

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Source alternative data providers for 2018-2021 fundamental data
2. Continue validation as more DART data becomes available (yearly updates)
3. Supplement with Monte Carlo simulation for stress testing

### 3. Market Regime Coverage

**2022-2025 Market Conditions**:
- 2022: Bear market recovery (post-COVID)
- 2023: Bull market rally (+18.7%)
- 2024: Moderate bear market (-9.6% YTD)

**Missing Regimes**:
- Full bull market cycle (2017-2018)
- COVID crash and recovery (2020)
- Prolonged bear market (2018-2019)

**Impact**:
- Strategy not tested in extreme volatility (COVID crash)
- Unknown performance in sustained bull markets
- Limited crisis scenario validation

## 🎯 Production Readiness Assessment

### Criteria Evaluation

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Positive Avg Return** | > 0% | +3.48% | ✅ PASS | Positive across both periods |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | > 1.0 | 0.0 | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | Parsing issue - needs manual verification |
| **Win Rate** | > 45% | 50% | ✅ PASS | Balanced win/loss |
| **Max Drawdown** | < -20% | 0.0 | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | Parsing issue - needs manual verification |
| **Positive Majority** | > 50% | 50% | ❌ FAIL | 1/2 periods positive |

### Overall Assessment: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

**Strengths**:
1. ✅ Successfully completed validation (vs previous failure)
2. ✅ Positive average return (+3.48%)
3. ✅ Strong downside protection (max loss -0.15%)
4. ✅ Outperformed KOSPI in 2024 down market (+9.45% alpha)
5. ✅ Low transaction costs (0.30% avg)
6. ✅ Well-diversified (~70 stocks)

**Weaknesses**:
1. ❌ Limited data (2.5 years only)
2. ❌ Small sample size (2 periods)
3. ❌ Win rate 50% (not majority positive)
4. ❌ Missing risk metrics (Sharpe, Max DD)
5. ❌ Underperformed in bull market (2023)

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ **Approve for PAPER TRADING** (simulated live trading)
- ❌ **Not ready for PRODUCTION** (live capital deployment)

**Rationale**:
- Strategy shows promise but needs more validation
- Paper trading will provide additional out-of-sample data
- Continue validation as more historical data becomes available
- Re-assess after 6-12 months of paper trading

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### 1. Data Availability is Critical

**Problem**: Previous validation failed completely due to missing 2018-2021 data

**Solution**: Aligned validation periods with DART API data availability (2022-2025)

**Takeaway**: Always verify data availability BEFORE designing validation framework

### 2. DART API Limitations

**Discovery**: DART API only provides fundamental data from 2022-12-31 onwards

**Impact**: Limited to 2.5 years of backtest data (vs. industry standard 5-10 years)

**Mitigation**: Consider alternative data providers for historical data

### 3. Walk-Forward Period Design

**Initial Design**: 2-year train, 1-year test (insufficient data)

**Final Design**: 1-year train, 1-year test (2 periods generated)

**Tradeoff**: Shorter training window (less IC stability) vs more test periods

**Recommendation**: As more data accumulates, revert to 2-year train window

### 4. Market Regime Matters

**2023 (Bull)**: +7.11% return, 100% win rate

**2024 (Bear)**: -0.15% return, 0% win rate

**Conclusion**: Strategy performs better in neutral/bear markets (downside protection)

**Implication**: May underperform in strong bull markets (conservative stock selection)

### 5. Parsing Reliability

**Issue**: Sharpe and Max DD parsed as 0.0 despite successful backtests

**Root Cause**: Output format mismatch between backtest script and parser

**Learning**: Always validate automated parsing with manual spot checks
