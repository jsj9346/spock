## Executive Summary

This report compares **IC-Weighted** vs **Equal-Weighted** multi-factor strategies across three percentile thresholds (60th, 70th, 80th). The analysis evaluates six distinct strategy configurations to determine optimal factor weighting and stock selection approaches for the Korean equity market.

### Key Findings

1. **IC-Weighted 60th percentile emerges as the most robust strategy** with:
   - Sharpe Ratio: **0.425** (best risk-adjusted performance among practical strategies)
   - Total Return: **121.50%** (strong absolute performance)
   - Max Drawdown: **-64.96%** (best drawdown control)
   - Diversification: **32.4 average positions** (adequate diversification)

2. **Equal-Weighted 80th percentile shows extreme outlier performance** (598.26% return, Sharpe 2.22) due to single-stock concentration - **NOT recommended** as a systematic strategy due to lack of diversification.

3. **No statistically significant differences** between weighting methods at any percentile threshold (all p-values > 0.13), indicating limited data for definitive conclusions.

4. **IC-weighting provides superior risk-adjusted returns** at 60th and 70th percentiles compared to equal-weighting.

## Factor Weighting Configurations

### IC-Weighted Strategy
Based on Information Coefficient (IC) performance from multi-factor analysis:

| Factor | Weight | IC Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Operating_Profit_Margin | 35% | 0.086 | Top IC performer - strongest predictive power |
| ROE_Proxy | 25% | 0.091 | Second-best IC - quality indicator |
| PE_Ratio | 20% | 0.051 | Value factor - moderate IC |
| 12M_Momentum | 15% | 0.043 | Trend-following signal |
| PB_Ratio | 5% | 0.031 | Secondary value factor - weakest IC |

**Composite Score Formula**: `IC_Score = Œ£(factor_percentile √ó IC_weight)`

### Equal-Weighted Strategy
Assigns equal importance to all factors:

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Operating_Profit_Margin | 20% | Equal importance assumption |
| ROE_Proxy | 20% | Equal importance assumption |
| PE_Ratio | 20% | Equal importance assumption |
| 12M_Momentum | 20% | Equal importance assumption |
| PB_Ratio | 20% | Equal importance assumption |

**Composite Score Formula**: `Equal_Score = mean(factor_percentiles)`

## Statistical Significance Analysis

### Two-Sample T-Test Results

| Percentile | Mean Return Difference (ann.) | t-statistic | p-value | Significant (Œ±=0.05) | Winner |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 60th | -144.77% | -0.300 | 0.7642 | **No** | Equal-Weighted |
| 70th | -42.42% | -0.072 | 0.9423 | **No** | Equal-Weighted |
| 80th | +1909.54% | 1.494 | 0.1359 | **No** | IC-Weighted |

**Interpretation**:
- **None of the performance differences are statistically significant** at the 5% level (all p-values > 0.13)
- Limited sample size (0.98 years) prevents definitive conclusions about superior weighting method
- Longer backtesting period (3-5 years) required for statistical significance
- Differences in Sharpe ratios suggest IC-weighting may have practical advantages despite lack of statistical significance

## Recommendations

### 1. Recommended Strategy: **IC-Weighted 60th Percentile**

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ **Best risk-adjusted returns**: Sharpe ratio 0.425 (highest among practical strategies)
- ‚úÖ **Superior drawdown control**: Max DD -64.96% (best performance)
- ‚úÖ **Adequate diversification**: 29-37 stocks reduces idiosyncratic risk
- ‚úÖ **Strong absolute returns**: 121.50% total return (125.83% annualized)
- ‚úÖ **Reasonable transaction costs**: 3.59% of initial capital
- ‚úÖ **Consistent performance**: 56.73% win rate (days with positive returns)

**Target Investors**: Aggressive growth investors seeking factor-based alpha with moderate risk management

---

### 2. Alternative Strategy: **Equal-Weighted 60th Percentile**

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ **Simpler implementation**: No IC estimation required, equal weights easier to explain
- ‚úÖ **Good absolute returns**: 103.54% total return
- ‚úÖ **Adequate diversification**: 21-27 stocks
- ‚úÖ **Lowest transaction costs**: 3.32% of initial capital
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lower Sharpe ratio**: 0.288 vs IC-weighted 0.425 (-32% worse risk-adjusted returns)

**Target Investors**: Investors preferring simplicity over marginal risk-adjusted return improvement

---

### 3. NOT Recommended

#### ‚ùå 80th Percentile Strategies (Both Weightings)

**Reasons**:
1. **Extreme concentration risk**: 1-3 stocks insufficient for systematic strategy
2. **Survivorship bias**: Equal-weighted 598% return due to lucky single-stock pick, not robust strategy design
3. **High volatility**: IC-weighted 1228% volatility unacceptable for risk management
4. **Excessive costs**: Equal-weighted 11% transaction costs destroy alpha
5. **Fragile performance**: Equal-weighted failed to find qualifying stocks in 7/8 rebalance periods

---

## Limitations and Caveats

### 1. Short Backtesting Period
- **Duration**: Only 0.98 years (246 trading days)
- **Impact**: Insufficient for statistical significance (all p-values > 0.13)
- **Recommendation**: Extend backtest to 3-5 years for robust conclusions

### 2. Market Regime Dependency
- **Period**: October 2024 - October 2025 (specific market conditions)
- **Impact**: Results may not generalize to different market regimes (bear markets, volatility spikes)
- **Recommendation**: Test across multiple market cycles (bull, bear, sideways)

### 3. Survivorship Bias Risk
- **Issue**: Equal-weighted 80th percentile "got lucky" with single stock selection
- **Impact**: 598% return NOT reproducible in different time periods
- **Recommendation**: Require minimum diversification (‚â•10 stocks) for systematic strategies

### 4. Factor Stability Assumption
- **Assumption**: IC rankings remain stable across rebalancing periods
- **Reality**: Factor performance can shift with market conditions
- **Recommendation**: Periodic IC recalibration (quarterly or semi-annually)

### 5. Transaction Cost Model
- **Assumptions**:
  - Commission: 0.015% (KIS API standard)
  - Slippage: 0.05% (market impact)
  - Spread: 0.10% (bid-ask)
- **Reality**: Costs may vary with market conditions, stock liquidity, order size
- **Recommendation**: Stress-test with higher cost scenarios (2x, 3x base case)

### 6. No Short-Selling Constraints
- **Assumption**: Long-only portfolio (realistic for most Korean retail investors)
- **Impact**: Cannot benefit from short-selling underperformers
- **Recommendation**: Consider long-short extension if investor qualifies

## Next Steps and Action Items

### Phase 1: Extended Backtesting (Priority: High)

1. **Extend Historical Period**
   ```bash
   # Backtest from 2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31 (5 years)
   python3 scripts/backtest_ic_weighted_strategy.py --start 2020-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --top-percentile 60
   python3 scripts/backtest_equal_weighted_strategy.py --start 2020-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --top-percentile 60
   ```

2. **Regime Analysis**
   - Identify bull/bear/sideways periods
   - Measure strategy performance in each regime
   - Assess consistency across market conditions

3. **Walk-Forward Optimization**
   - Train IC weights on 3-year rolling window
   - Test on subsequent 1-year out-of-sample period
   - Validate IC stability over time

---

### Phase 2: Robustness Testing (Priority: High)

1. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Test percentile thresholds: 55th, 60th, 65th (fine-tuning around optimal)
   - Test rebalancing frequencies: Weekly, monthly, quarterly
   - Test alternative factor combinations (remove weakest factors)

2. **Transaction Cost Stress Testing**
   - Double transaction costs (0.66% round-trip) and measure impact
   - Model large order market impact for institutional portfolios
   - Analyze break-even transaction cost levels

3. **Factor Decay Analysis**
   - Measure factor signal decay over time (1-day, 5-day, 21-day holding periods)
   - Validate monthly rebalancing is optimal frequency
   - Test adaptive rebalancing based on factor signal strength

---

### Phase 3: Strategy Enhancement (Priority: Medium)

1. **Risk Management Overlays**
   - Implement maximum drawdown limits (-20%, -30%, -40% thresholds)
   - Add volatility targeting (scale positions inversely with volatility)
   - Implement sector concentration limits (max 40% per sector)

2. **Dynamic IC Weighting**
   - Recalculate IC weights quarterly based on rolling 2-year window
   - Implement adaptive weighting based on recent factor performance
   - Test hybrid IC + equal-weight approach (e.g., 70% IC + 30% equal)

3. **Factor Timing**
   - Identify when specific factors work (market regimes, volatility levels)
   - Implement regime-switching factor allocation
   - Test market-neutral long-short extension

---

### Phase 4: Production Implementation (Priority: Low)

1. **Live Trading Preparation**
   - Real-time factor score calculation pipeline
   - Order execution system with KIS API integration
   - Portfolio tracking and rebalancing automation

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time portfolio value tracking
   - Deviation alerts (vs backtest expectations)
   - Transaction cost monitoring and optimization

3. **Risk Limits**
   - Maximum position size: 5% per stock
   - Maximum sector allocation: 40% per sector
   - Stop-loss triggers: Individual (-15%) and portfolio (-25%) levels

---

## Conclusion

The **IC-Weighted 60th percentile strategy** demonstrates superior risk-adjusted performance compared to equal-weighting and higher percentile thresholds. Key advantages include:

1. **Best Sharpe Ratio**: 0.425 vs equal-weighted 0.288 (+48% improvement)
2. **Superior Risk Control**: -64.96% max drawdown (best among all strategies)
3. **Adequate Diversification**: 32.4 average positions reduces idiosyncratic risk
4. **Strong Absolute Returns**: 121.50% total return over 0.98 years

However, **extended backtesting (3-5 years)** is **mandatory** before live deployment to:
- Validate statistical significance of IC-weighting advantage
- Test performance across multiple market regimes
- Confirm factor IC stability over time
- Stress-test transaction cost assumptions

The 80th percentile equal-weighted strategy's 598% return is an **outlier** driven by single-stock concentration and should **NOT** be interpreted as a systematic, reproducible result.

**Recommended Action**: Proceed with Phase 1 (Extended Backtesting) before considering live deployment.
