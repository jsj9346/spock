## Executive Summary

**Hypothesis**: Equal-weighted multi-factor strategy (1/3 per factor) will avoid catastrophic losses by removing IC estimation error from regime changes.

**Success Criterion**: Max Drawdown < -30%

**Result**: ‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

Equal-weighted strategy suffered **-51.27% maximum drawdown** in Period 1 (2022 bear market), only 7.86 percentage points better than IC-weighted (-59.13%), but still **CATASTROPHICALLY WORSE** than the -30% threshold.

**Critical Finding**: **Factor scores themselves are wrong during regime changes, not just IC weights.**

## Results Comparison: IC-Weighted vs Equal-Weighted

### Period 1 (2022 Test Year - Bear Market)

| Metric | IC-Weighted | Equal-Weighted | Improvement | Status |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Return** | **-59.18%** | **-51.33%** | +7.85 pp | ‚ùå Both catastrophic |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | -56.74 | -447.73 | -390.99 | ‚ùå Equal worse! |
| **Max Drawdown** | **-59.13%** | **-51.27%** | +7.86 pp | ‚ùå Both catastrophic |
| **Win Rate** | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0 pp | ‚ùå No wins |
| **Avg Holdings** | 55 | 67 | +12 stocks | More diversification |
| **Transaction Costs** | 0.29% | 0.47% | -0.18% | Higher cost |

**Analysis**: Equal-weighted reduced loss from -59.18% to -51.33%, but this 7.85 percentage point improvement is **MEANINGLESS** in a catastrophic failure scenario. Both strategies lost over half of capital.

---

### Period 2 (2023 Test Year - Recovery)

| Metric | IC-Weighted | Equal-Weighted | Difference |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Return** | **+7.11%** | **+7.11%** | 0.0 pp |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.0 |
| **Max Drawdown** | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.0 pp |
| **Win Rate** | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0 pp |
| **Avg Holdings** | 68 | 68 | 0 |
| **Transaction Costs** | 0.45% | 0.45% | 0.0% |

**Analysis**: Both methods performed **identically** in Period 2. This suggests:
1. IC weighting had minimal impact during stable markets (2023)
2. Equal weighting provides no advantage in positive markets
3. Period 2 success was due to **market conditions**, not strategy quality

### Overall Metrics (2-Period Average)

| Metric | IC-Weighted | Equal-Weighted | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Average Return** | **-26.04%** | **-22.11%** | +3.93 pp ‚ùå |
| **Average Sharpe** | -28.37 | -223.87 | -195.50 ‚ùå |
| **Average Max DD** | **-29.57%** | **-25.64%** | +3.93 pp ‚ùå |
| **Worst Max DD** | **-59.13%** | **-51.27%** | +7.86 pp ‚ùå |
| **Positive Periods** | 1/2 (50%) | 1/2 (50%) | 0.0 pp |

**Verdict**: Equal-weighted marginally improved average loss but **FAILED** the production readiness test (-30% Max DD threshold).

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Equal-Weighted Failed

### Theory vs Reality

**Expected** (Hypothesis):
- IC-weighted uses wrong IC during regime changes ‚Üí catastrophic loss
- Equal-weighted removes IC estimation error ‚Üí avoids catastrophic loss

**Actual** (Results):
- Equal-weighted **still** suffered catastrophic loss (-51.33%)
- Improvement only 7.85 percentage points (not meaningful)

### Deep Analysis

**The Real Problem is NOT IC Weighting - It's Factor Score Stability**

#### Evidence 1: Factor Scores Flip During Regime Changes

From Phase 2.2 IC Stability Analysis:

```
2021-06-30 (Training Period):
- Operating_Profit_Margin IC: -0.148 (NEGATIVE!)
- RSI_Momentum IC: -0.081 (NEGATIVE!)
- ROE_Proxy IC: -0.178 (NEGATIVE!)

2022-06-30 (Test Period):
- RSI_Momentum IC: -0.436 (DEEPLY NEGATIVE!)
```

**What This Means**:
- During 2021 growth rally, fundamental factors (Operating Profit Margin, ROE) had **NEGATIVE correlation** with future returns
- During 2022 bear market, momentum factors (RSI) had **DEEPLY NEGATIVE correlation** with returns
- **Factor scores themselves became anti-predictive**

#### Evidence 2: Equal Weighting Doesn't Fix Anti-Predictive Factors

**Equal-weighted composite score formula**:
```
Composite Score = (Operating_Profit_Margin + RSI_Momentum + ROE_Proxy) / 3
```

If ALL three factors have negative IC (anti-predictive):
- IC-weighted: Assigns weights based on |IC|, selects WRONG stocks (IC direction is wrong)
- Equal-weighted: Assigns 1/3 to each, STILL selects WRONG stocks (factor scores are wrong)

**Example (Simplified)**:

Stock A (high composite score) during 2021:
- High Operating Profit Margin: 90 (but this predicts LOWER returns in 2022!)
- High RSI Momentum: 85 (but this predicts LOWER returns in 2022!)
- High ROE: 80 (but this predicts LOWER returns in 2022!)
- Equal-weighted composite: (90+85+80)/3 = **85** ‚Üí **BUY**

Stock B (low composite score) during 2021:
- Low Operating Profit Margin: 30 (but this will OUTPERFORM in 2022!)
- Low RSI Momentum: 25 (but this will OUTPERFORM in 2022!)
- Low ROE: 35 (but this will OUTPERFORM in 2022!)
- Equal-weighted composite: (30+25+35)/3 = **30** ‚Üí **AVOID**

**Outcome in 2022**: Buy Stock A (crashes -50%), Avoid Stock B (rises +10%) ‚Üí Catastrophic loss

#### Evidence 3: Transaction Costs Increased

Equal-weighted selected **MORE** stocks (67 vs 55 in Period 1):
- Higher diversification? No benefit - still lost -51.33%
- Higher transaction costs: 0.47% vs 0.29% (62% more expensive)
- **More stocks with wrong factor scores = More catastrophic positions**

---

## Fundamental Problem: Non-Stationary Factor Performance

### The Core Issue

**Factor-based strategies assume**:
- Factors that predicted returns in the past will continue to predict in the future
- Factor scores are stationary (stable relationship with future returns)

**Reality in 2021-2022 Regime Change**:
- Growth stocks (high momentum) dominated 2021 ‚Üí Factor scores learned: "Buy high RSI"
- Value stocks (low P/E) dominated 2022 ‚Üí Factor scores should have learned: "Buy low valuation"
- **But we used 2021 factor scores in 2022** ‚Üí Selected growth stocks at market peak ‚Üí Catastrophic loss

**Market Regime Shift**:
```
2021 (Growth Rally):        2022 (Value Rotation):
‚úÖ High RSI ‚Üí High Return    ‚ùå High RSI ‚Üí LOW Return (crashed)
‚úÖ High ROE ‚Üí High Return    ‚ùå High ROE ‚Üí LOW Return (overvalued)
‚úÖ High OPM ‚Üí High Return    ‚ùå High OPM ‚Üí LOW Return (earnings compression)
```

**Neither IC-weighting NOR Equal-weighting can fix this** because:
- IC-weighting: Uses wrong IC from past regime
- Equal-weighting: Uses wrong factor scores from past regime

**The factor scores themselves are the problem, not how we weight them.**

## Why Phase 2.3 Results Differed

**Phase 2.3 (Partial)**: Equal-weighted lost -8.62% in Period 2 (2023 test)
**Phase 3 (Full)**: Equal-weighted gained +7.11% in Period 2 (2023 test)

**Difference**: 15.73 percentage points!

**Root Cause**: Phase 2.3 had **implementation bugs** (different backtest logic than production):
- Different rebalance date selection
- Different liquidation/buy logic
- Different transaction cost calculation

**Lesson Learned**: Phase 2.3's custom backtest implementation was unreliable. Phase 3 used production-tested `backtest_orthogonal_factors.py` ‚Üí Correct results.

## Success Criterion Evaluation

### Target: Max Drawdown < -30%

**Result**: **FAILED ‚ùå**

| Criterion | Target | IC-Weighted | Equal-Weighted | Pass? |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Worst Max DD** | **< -30%** | -59.13% | **-51.27%** | ‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC** |
| Avg Max DD | < -20% | -29.57% | -25.64% | ‚ùå |
| Positive Return | > 0% | -26.04% | -22.11% | ‚ùå |
| Sharpe > 1.0 | Yes | -28.37 | -223.87 | ‚ùå |
| Win Rate > 45% | Yes | 50% | 50% | ‚úÖ |

**Verdict**: Equal-weighted strategy **CATASTROPHICALLY FAILED** production readiness test.

**Max Drawdown Comparison**:
- Target: **-30%** (acceptable risk)
- IC-weighted: **-59.13%** (97% WORSE than target)
- Equal-weighted: **-51.27%** (71% WORSE than target)

**Improvement Analysis**:
- Equal-weighted improved Max DD by 7.86 percentage points
- But still **21.27 percentage points WORSE** than -30% target
- **Meaningless improvement in catastrophic failure scenario**

## Implications

### What We Learned

1. **IC-weighting is NOT the root cause** of catastrophic losses
2. **Factor scores become anti-predictive** during regime changes
3. **Equal-weighting does NOT solve non-stationarity** of factor performance
4. **Diversification (67 stocks vs 55) does NOT help** when ALL factors are wrong

### What This Means for Phase 3

**Option A: Equal-Weighted Multi-Factor** ‚Üí ‚ùå **FAILED**

**Next Steps (User Directive)**: "Îã§Ïùå Ï†ÑÎûµÏúºÎ°ú ÏßÑÌñâ" (Proceed to next strategy)

**Available Strategies** (from Phase 2 recommendations):

**Option B: Single-Factor Strategies**
- Test RSI_Momentum only
- Test Operating_Profit_Margin only
- Hypothesis: Single factor may be more stable than composite

**Option C: Buy-and-Hold with Fundamental Screens**
- Static portfolio of high-quality stocks
- No rebalancing ‚Üí No regime change risk

**Option D: Machine Learning Factor Combination**
- Non-linear factor relationships
- Adaptive weighting based on market regime

**Option E: Abandon Factor-Based Approach Entirely**
- Benchmark: Buy-and-hold KOSPI ETF
- Benchmark: Buy-and-hold top 10 market cap stocks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚ùå **ABANDON Equal-Weighted Multi-Factor Strategy** (catastrophic failure -51.27% Max DD)
2. üìã **Proceed to Option B: Single-Factor Strategies** (user directive)
   - Start with RSI_Momentum only (most stable IC in Phase 2.2: -0.436 consistent)
   - Then test Operating_Profit_Margin only
3. üéØ **Reassess Success Criterion**: -30% Max DD may be too optimistic
   - Historical KOSPI Max DD: -24.9% (2022)
   - Strategy Max DD should be **better** than buy-and-hold, not worse

### Long-Term Strategy

**If Single-Factor Strategies Fail**:
- Consider **dynamic factor selection** (switch factors based on market regime detection)
- Consider **defensive positioning** during high volatility regimes
- Consider **benchmark comparison**: Is factor-based approach viable at all?

**Root Cause to Address**:
- Factor non-stationarity during regime changes
- Need **adaptive methodology** that detects regime shifts
- Need **defensive mechanisms** to reduce drawdown during transitions
