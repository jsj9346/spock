# Monthly Rebalancing Failure Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Issue**: Monthly rebalancing causes catastrophic losses (-87.66%)
**Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL STRATEGY FAILURE IDENTIFIED**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Monthly rebalancing of the IC-weighted Tier 3 strategy resulted in **catastrophic losses** compared to quarterly rebalancing:

- **Quarterly (Q)**: +7.11% return, 100% win rate, ₩107M final value
- **Monthly (M)**: -87.66% return, 0% win rate, ₩12M final value
- **Performance Delta**: **-94.77 percentage points**

**Root Cause**: The IC-weighted factor selection system is **fundamentally unstable** at monthly rebalancing frequency, causing systematic selection of losing stocks.

**Critical Finding**: This is NOT a transaction cost issue (+0.44% difference) but a **strategy design flaw** that makes the system **unsuitable for frequent rebalancing**.

## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

### Transaction Cost Analysis (NOT the cause)

**Quarterly Costs**:
- Total: ₩454,632 (0.45% of capital)
- Per Rebalance: ₩227,316
- Impact on Return: -0.45%

**Monthly Costs**:
- Total: ₩887,740 (0.89% of capital)
- Per Rebalance: ₩98,638
- Impact on Return: -0.89%

**Cost Delta**: 0.44 percentage points
**Performance Delta**: **94.77 percentage points**

**Conclusion**: Transaction costs explain only **0.47%** of the performance gap. The real issue is **systematic stock selection failure**.

### IC Stability Analysis (PRIMARY SUSPECT 🎯)

**Information Coefficient (IC)** measures the correlation between factor scores and future returns.

**Hypothesis**: IC becomes **unstable and noisy** at monthly frequency, causing:
1. **Overfitting to short-term noise**: Monthly IC calculations capture market noise rather than true factor signal
2. **Whipsaw Trading**: Frequent rebalancing based on unstable IC causes entering/exiting at worst times
3. **Signal Decay**: Factor predictive power may decay faster than monthly intervals

**Evidence**:
- Quarterly IC (calculated over 252 days) → Stable, fewer signals → 100% win rate
- Monthly IC (recalculated monthly) → Noisy, frequent signals → 0% win rate

**Test Needed**: Compare IC autocorrelation at quarterly vs monthly frequency

### Factor Overfitting Analysis (SECONDARY SUSPECT 📊)

**Tier 3 Factors**:
1. Operating_Profit_Margin (fundamental quality)
2. RSI_Momentum (technical momentum)
3. ROE_Proxy (profitability)

**Hypothesis**: Factors may be **overfit to training period** and fail when applied at higher frequency

**Evidence**:
- Training period: 2022-01-01 to 2023-01-01
- Test period: 2023-01-02 to 2024-01-02
- Quarterly rebalancing uses 2 snapshots → works (maybe lucky?)
- Monthly rebalancing uses 9 snapshots → fails systematically

**Implication**: The strategy may not generalize well to out-of-sample periods when rebalanced frequently.

### Market Regime Analysis (TERTIARY FACTOR 🌊)

**2023 Market Context**:
- KOSPI 2023 Performance: +18.7%
- Quarterly Strategy: +7.11% (underperformed market but positive)
- Monthly Strategy: -87.66% (catastrophic underperformance)

**Hypothesis**: Monthly rebalancing may be **contra-trend** at critical turning points

**Example**:
- February 2023: -26.21% loss (market may have been rebounding)
- July 2023: -32.96% loss (market may have been rallying)

**Implication**: IC-weighted selection at monthly frequency may be selecting stocks that:
- Recently performed well (momentum) but are about to reverse
- Have strong fundamentals (value/quality) but are out of favor short-term

## 🎯 Critical Insights

### 1. IC-Weighted Strategy is Frequency-Dependent

**Discovery**: The same factor combination (Operating_Profit_Margin + RSI_Momentum + ROE_Proxy) produces:
- **Positive returns** at quarterly frequency (+7.11%)
- **Catastrophic losses** at monthly frequency (-87.66%)

**Implication**: Rebalancing frequency is NOT a tunable parameter but a **fundamental strategy design choice**.

### 2. More Frequent ≠ Better Metrics

**Original Assumption** (from metric parsing report):
> "Monthly rebalancing (12 rebalances/year) provides sufficient data for accurate Sharpe ratio calculation"

**Reality**:
- Monthly rebalancing DOES provide sufficient data (9 rebalances)
- Sharpe ratio IS calculated (-34.09)
- But the strategy **fundamentally fails** at this frequency

**Lesson**: **Statistical validity ≠ Strategy validity**

### 3. Quarterly Results May Be Noise

**Concerning Pattern**:
- Quarterly: 100% win rate (2/2 profitable rebalances)
- Monthly: 0% win rate (0/9 profitable rebalances)

**Statistical Question**: Is the quarterly +7.11% return just **lucky timing** with only 2 data points?

**Evidence Suggesting Luck**:
- Small sample size (n=2 rebalances)
- Monthly results show consistent losses across 9 periods
- 2/2 wins could be random chance with small n

**Recommended Test**: Extend quarterly validation to more periods (require ≥5 rebalances)

### 4. Strategy Robustness is Questionable

**Production Readiness Implications**:
- ❌ **Not robust to rebalancing frequency** (critical failure)
- ❌ **No evidence of consistent alpha generation** (monthly shows systematic losses)
- ❌ **High sensitivity to parameter choices** (frequency = 94% performance swing)

**Conclusion**: The IC-weighted Tier 3 strategy is **NOT production-ready** due to fundamental instability.

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today) 🚨

**1. DO NOT USE MONTHLY REBALANCING**
- Monthly rebalancing results in systematic losses
- This is not a data/metric issue but a **strategy design flaw**
- Production deployment at monthly frequency would be **catastrophic**

**2. INVESTIGATE QUARTERLY RESULTS VALIDITY**
- 100% win rate with n=2 is statistically suspicious
- May be luck rather than skill
- Require longer validation period (5+ years if possible)

**3. HALT PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
- Current validation shows strategy is **not robust**
- Frequency sensitivity indicates **fundamental design issue**
- Production deployment would be **high risk**

### Short-Term Analysis (This Week) 📊

**4. ANALYZE IC STABILITY**
Create `scripts/analyze_ic_stability.py` to:
- Calculate IC at different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Measure IC autocorrelation
- Identify optimal rebalancing frequency for each factor
- Detect when IC signal decays

**5. BACKTEST ALTERNATIVE FREQUENCIES**
Test intermediate frequencies:
- **Bi-monthly** (every 2 months): 6 rebalances/year
- **Quarterly** (confirmed): 4 rebalances/year
- **Semi-annual** (every 6 months): 2 rebalances/year
- **Annual**: 1 rebalance/year

Identify if there's a "sweet spot" where strategy is both:
- Robust (positive returns)
- Frequent enough for meaningful metrics (≥5 rebalances)

**6. TEST INDIVIDUAL FACTORS**
Run backtests with:
- Single-factor strategies (isolate which factor is unstable)
- Different factor combinations
- Alternative IC weighting schemes (equal weight, inverse volatility)

### Long-Term Redesign (Next Month) 🔬

**7. IMPLEMENT ADAPTIVE REBALANCING**
Instead of fixed frequency, rebalance based on:
- **IC Change Threshold**: Only rebalance when IC changes significantly
- **Volatility Regime**: Reduce frequency during high volatility
- **Market Regime Detection**: Adjust frequency based on market conditions

**8. ADD TRANSACTION COST MODEL TO OPTIMIZATION**
Current IC optimization ignores transaction costs. Modify to:
- Penalize frequent turnover
- Optimize for net alpha (gross alpha - transaction costs)
- Constrain rebalancing frequency based on cost/benefit

**9. CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES**
Given fundamental instability, explore:
- **Buy-and-hold with factor screens** (no rebalancing)
- **Event-driven rebalancing** (only when stocks drop out of top percentile)
- **Machine learning models** that don't rely on IC weighting

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### 1. More Data Points ≠ Better Strategy

**Initial Goal**: Get more rebalances (12 vs 4) to calculate accurate Sharpe ratio

**Reality**: More frequent rebalancing **broke the strategy** entirely

**Lesson**: Statistical validity and strategy robustness are **orthogonal concerns**

### 2. Rebalancing Frequency is Not a Free Parameter

**Assumption**: Rebalancing frequency is an optimization parameter (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**Discovery**: Frequency fundamentally changes strategy behavior:
- Quarterly: Moderate positive returns
- Monthly: Catastrophic losses

**Lesson**: Rebalancing frequency is a **core strategy design choice**, not a tunable parameter

### 3. IC-Weighted Strategies Are Frequency-Sensitive

**Finding**: Information Coefficient calculations are **highly sensitive** to:
- Rolling window length (currently 252 days)
- Rebalancing frequency (quarterly vs monthly)
- Factor stability over rebalancing interval

**Implication**: IC-weighted strategies require **careful frequency calibration** - cannot arbitrarily change rebalancing schedule

### 4. Small Sample Validation is Dangerous

**Quarterly Validation**:
- 2 periods = 100% win rate = +7.11% return
- Looked "successful" but was it luck?

**Monthly Validation**:
- 9 periods = 0% win rate = -87.66% return
- Systematic failure exposed

**Lesson**: **Require minimum 5-10 rebalances** for meaningful validation (not 2!)

### 5. Transaction Costs Are Red Herring

**Initial Suspicion**: Higher monthly transaction costs (0.89% vs 0.45%) cause losses

**Reality**: Costs explain <0.5% of 94.77% performance gap

**Lesson**: Always check **order of magnitude** - don't optimize pennies while losing dollars

## 🚨 Production Deployment Warning

### DO NOT DEPLOY THIS STRATEGY

**Reasons**:
1. ❌ **Not robust to rebalancing frequency** (94% performance swing)
2. ❌ **No evidence of consistent alpha** (monthly shows 0% win rate)
3. ❌ **High parameter sensitivity** (critical design flaw)
4. ❌ **Quarterly results may be luck** (n=2 statistically insufficient)
5. ❌ **No understanding of failure mode** (IC instability unproven hypothesis)

### Required Before Production

1. ✅ **IC Stability Analysis**: Understand why monthly fails
2. ✅ **Extended Validation**: ≥5 years with ≥20 rebalances (quarterly)
3. ✅ **Robustness Testing**: Verify consistent performance across multiple time periods
4. ✅ **Parameter Sensitivity**: Understand all parameter impacts
5. ✅ **Failure Mode Analysis**: Identify and mitigate failure scenarios
