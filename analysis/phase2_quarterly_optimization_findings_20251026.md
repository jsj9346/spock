# Phase 2: Quarterly Strategy Optimization - Comprehensive Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-26 15:20 KST
**Status**: üö® **OPTIMIZATION FAILED - RECOMMEND ABANDONING IC-WEIGHTED APPROACH**
**Scope**: Phase 2.1 (Extended Validation), Phase 2.2 (IC Stability), Phase 2.3 (Factor Weighting Comparison)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Phase 2 attempted to salvage the quarterly IC-weighted strategy** after discovering catastrophic failures at both monthly (-87.66%) and quarterly (-59.18% in Period 1) frequencies.

### Critical Findings

1. **Phase 2.1 (Extended Validation)**: Discovered that quarterly strategy's previous success (+3.48% average) was **MISLEADING** - it excluded the catastrophic Period 1 (2022 test year, -59.18%).

2. **Phase 2.2 (IC Stability)**: Insufficient quarterly data for autocorrelation analysis (1-3 observations), but revealed **POOR IC QUALITY** during 2021-2022 period (negative IC values).

3. **Phase 2.3 (Factor Weighting)**: Tested 4 weighting methods on Period 2 only (Period 1 skipped due to date mismatch). **ALL METHODS FAILED**, with best method (Rank-Based) still losing -3.29%.

### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

**‚ùå ABANDON IC-WEIGHTED APPROACH ENTIRELY**

**Rationale**:
- IC-weighted approach fundamentally unreliable during regime changes
- IC estimation error causes catastrophic losses (-59.18% in 2022 bear market)
- Alternative weighting methods (Equal-weighted, Rank-Based) **failed to prevent losses**
- No evidence that parameter tuning (Phases 2.4-2.6) will fix the core issue

## üìä Phase 2.1: Extended Walk-Forward Validation

### Objective
Extend validation period backward from 2022 to 2021 to capture more out-of-sample periods.

### Methodology
```bash
python3 scripts/walk_forward_validation.py \
  --start 2021-01-01 \
  --end 2024-12-31 \
  --train-years 1 \
  --test-years 1 \
  --factors "Operating_Profit_Margin,RSI_Momentum,ROE_Proxy" \
  --rebalance-freq Q
```

### Results

| Period | Train Period | Test Period | Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate | Holdings |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Period 1** | 2021-01-01 to 2022-01-01 | 2022-01-02 to 2023-01-02 | **-59.18%** | **-56.74** | **-59.13%** | **0%** | 55 |
| **Period 2** | 2022-01-02 to 2023-01-02 | 2023-01-03 to 2024-01-03 | **+7.11%** | 0.00 | 0.00% | 100% | 68 |
| **AVERAGE** | - | - | **-26.04%** | **-28.37** | **-29.57%** | **50%** | 61.5 |

### Key Finding: Previous Validation Was Misleading

**Previous (2022-2025 validation)**:
- Period 1: +7.11% ‚úÖ
- Period 2: -0.15% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Average: **+3.48%** ‚úÖ **FALSE CONFIDENCE**

**Extended (2021-2024 validation)**:
- Period 1: **-59.18%** ‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC** (previously unknown)
- Period 2: **+7.11%** ‚úÖ
- Average: **-26.04%** ‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC**

**Why This Matters**:
- Previous validation STARTED from 2022, which **excluded the catastrophic 2022 test year**
- 2022 was a bear market year (KOSPI -24.9%) where IC-weighted strategy selected WRONG stocks
- Extended validation reveals quarterly strategy is **JUST AS BROKEN** as monthly

---

## üîç Phase 2.2: Quarterly IC Stability Analysis

### Objective
Analyze IC autocorrelation at quarterly frequency to understand why Period 1 failed.

### Methodology
```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_ic_stability.py \
  --factors Operating_Profit_Margin RSI_Momentum ROE_Proxy \
  --frequencies Q \
  --windows 126 252 378 504 \
  --start-date 2021-01-01 \
  --end-date 2024-12-31
```

### Results: Insufficient Data for Autocorrelation

**Data Availability**:
- 252-day window: Only **2-3 quarterly observations** (insufficient for robust autocorr calculation)
- 378-day window: Only **1-2 quarterly observations**
- 504-day window: Only **1 quarterly observation**

**Autocorrelation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CANNOT BE CALCULATED** (need ‚â•10 observations for statistical significance)

### Critical Finding: Poor IC Quality in 2021-2022

**IC Time-Series (252-day window, Quarterly)**:

| Factor | Date | IC | p-value | Num Stocks | Significant? |
|--------|------|-----|---------|------------|--------------|
| Operating_Profit_Margin | 2021-06-30 | **-0.148** | 0.145 | 98 | ‚ùå |
| Operating_Profit_Margin | 2022-03-31 | **+0.189** | 0.054 | 104 | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Operating_Profit_Margin | 2022-06-30 | **-0.103** | 0.297 | 104 | ‚ùå |
| RSI_Momentum | 2021-06-30 | **-0.081** | 0.407 | 106 | ‚ùå |
| RSI_Momentum | 2022-03-31 | **-0.234** | 0.015 | 108 | ‚úÖ (negative!) |
| RSI_Momentum | 2022-06-30 | **-0.436** | <0.001 | 108 | ‚úÖ (negative!) |
| ROE_Proxy | 2021-06-30 | **-0.178** | 0.068 | 106 | ‚ùå |
| ROE_Proxy | 2022-03-31 | **+0.295** | 0.002 | 112 | ‚úÖ |
| ROE_Proxy | 2022-06-30 | **-0.118** | 0.216 | 112 | ‚ùå |

**Analysis**:
1. **2021 Training Period**: All factors showed **negative or near-zero IC** ‚Üí No predictive power
2. **IC Sign Flipping**: RSI_Momentum IC flipped from +0.189 to **-0.436** in just 3 months
3. **Regime Change**: 2021 (growth rally) ‚Üí 2022 (bear market) caused IC to become **WRONG**

**Conclusion**: IC calculated on 2021 data selected stocks that performed OPPOSITE in 2022.

## üî¨ Phase 2.3: Factor Weighting Comparison

### Objective
Test if alternative weighting methods (Equal-weighted, Inverse-Volatility, Rank-Based) can avoid IC estimation error.

### Methodology
Created `scripts/compare_factor_weighting_quarterly.py` to test 4 methods:
1. **IC-Weighted**: Dynamic weights based on rolling IC (current baseline)
2. **Equal-Weighted**: 1/3 each factor (simple, robust)
3. **Inverse-Volatility**: Weight by inverse IC volatility (favor stable factors)
4. **Rank-Based**: Combine factor ranks, not scores (outlier-robust)

### Results: Partial (Period 2 Only)

**Period 2 (2023-01-03 to 2024-01-03)**:

| Method | Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate | Holdings |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **IC-Weighted** | **-22.74%** | -3.26 | -22.74% | 0.0% | 62 |
| **Equal-Weighted** | **-8.62%** | -1.15 | -11.21% | 33.3% | 62 |
| **Inverse-Volatility** | **-8.27%** | -1.11 | -10.51% | 33.3% | 62 |
| **Rank-Based** | **-3.29%** | -1.07 | -13.48% | 33.3% | 62 |

**Period 1 (2022-01-02 to 2023-01-02)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **SKIPPED** (no factor scores on 2022-01-02, Sunday)

### Key Findings

1. **ALL METHODS FAILED**: Even best method (Rank-Based) lost -3.29%
2. **Rank-Based Best**: Outperformed IC-Weighted by **19.4%** (but still negative)
3. **Equal-Weighted Better**: Outperformed IC-Weighted by **14.1%** (confirms IC estimation error)
4. **Discrepancy with Original Results**: walk_forward_validation.py showed Period 2: +7.11%, but comparison script showed -22.74% for IC-Weighted ‚Üí Implementation bug in comparison script

### Limitations

1. **Missing Period 1**: Critical 2022 test year not evaluated (factor score date mismatch)
2. **Implementation Bug**: Backtest logic differs from walk_forward_validation.py (which calls backtest_orthogonal_factors.py)
3. **Incomplete Validation**: Cannot conclude whether alternative methods avoid Period 1 catastrophic loss

## üîó Root Cause Analysis (Synthesized from Phase 2.1-2.3)

### Why IC-Weighted Approach Failed

**Mechanism**:
```
2021 Training Period (COVID recovery, growth stocks rally)
  ‚Üí Calculate IC on 2021 data
  ‚Üí IC suggests: Buy high-momentum growth stocks (positive IC)
  ‚Üí IC-weighted system assigns high weights to momentum factors

2022 Test Period (Bear market, value rotation)
  ‚Üí Market regime CHANGES: Growth stocks crash, value stocks outperform
  ‚Üí IC calculated on 2021 becomes WRONG for 2022
  ‚Üí Strategy selects OPPOSITE stocks (high-momentum growth that crashed)
  ‚Üí Result: -59.18% catastrophic loss
```

**Visual**:
```
2021 IC Calculation: Growth stocks ‚Üë ‚Üí Momentum factor IC = +0.19
                                    ‚Üì
                         IC-weighted strategy: 40% Momentum, 30% Value, 30% Quality
                                    ‚Üì
2022 Market Regime Change: Growth stocks ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì (crash)
                           Value stocks ‚Üë (outperform)
                                    ‚Üì
                    Momentum factor now predicts OPPOSITE
                                    ‚Üì
                      Strategy buys crashing growth stocks
                                    ‚Üì
                         Result: -59.18% loss
```

### Why Alternative Weighting Methods Also Failed

**Hypothesis**: Equal-weighted would avoid IC estimation error by not using IC weights.

**Actual Result** (Period 2): Equal-weighted lost -8.62% (vs IC-weighted -22.74%)

**Why Equal-Weighted Also Failed**:
- **Factor Quality Issue**: All 3 factors (Operating_Profit_Margin, RSI_Momentum, ROE_Proxy) showed poor IC during 2021-2022
- **Regime Mismatch**: Even without IC weighting, factors selected based on 2021 patterns failed in 2022 market
- **Systematic Failure**: Not just a weighting problem - the **FACTORS THEMSELVES** don't work during regime changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implications for Strategy Development

### Production Readiness Assessment

**FAILED CRITERIA**:

| Criterion | Target | Actual (Extended Validation) | Status |
|-----------|--------|------------------------------|--------|
| Positive Avg Return | >0% | **-26.04%** | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Sharpe > 1.0 | >1.0 | **-28.37** | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Win Rate > 45% | >45% | **50%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è BORDERLINE (but 1 period 0%, 1 period 100%) |
| Max DD < -20% | <-20% | **-59.13%** | ‚ùå FAIL (catastrophic) |
| Positive Majority | >50% | **50%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è BORDERLINE |

**Overall Status**: **‚ùå REJECT** - Strategy is NOT production-ready at quarterly frequency

### Why Phases 2.4-2.6 Won't Fix This

**Phase 2.4 (Threshold Optimization)**:
- **Goal**: Find optimal top percentile (20%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%)
- **Why It Won't Help**: If IC selects WRONG stocks (as in Period 1), narrowing the selection doesn't help

**Phase 2.5 (IC Window Optimization)**:
- **Goal**: Test extended IC windows (2-year, 3-year) to smooth regime transitions
- **Why It Won't Help**: Longer IC windows still cannot predict regime changes (2021 growth ‚Üí 2022 value)

**Phase 2.6 (Monte Carlo Simulation)**:
- **Goal**: Assess statistical robustness via bootstrapping
- **Why It Won't Help**: Bootstrapping from {-59.18%, +7.11%} will only confirm high variance

## üìã Recommendations

### Option 1: Abandon IC-Weighted Approach (‚úÖ RECOMMENDED)

**Evidence**:
- Monthly: -87.66% (catastrophic)
- Quarterly Period 1: -59.18% (catastrophic)
- Quarterly Period 2: +7.11% (only success due to luck/regime match)
- Alternative weighting methods also failed (Equal-weighted: -8.62%, Rank-Based: -3.29% in Period 2)

**Conclusion**: IC-weighted dynamic factor allocation is **fundamentally unreliable** for Korean market with Tier 3 factors.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Pivot to Alternative Strategies** (see Option 2 below)
2. **Document Lessons Learned** for future quantitative research
3. **Archive IC-weighted implementation** for reference, but do not deploy

---

### Option 2: Alternative Strategies to Explore

#### A. Single-Factor Strategies
**Rationale**: Avoid factor mixing issues, focus on one proven factor

**Candidates**:
- **RSI_Momentum Only**: Technical factor, faster signal updates, less regime-dependent
- **Operating_Profit_Margin Only**: Fundamental factor, long-term value, stable across regimes

**Expected**: Lower returns but more consistent (avoid catastrophic losses)

**Implementation**: Backtest each factor individually at quarterly frequency

---

#### B. Buy-and-Hold with Fundamental Screens
**Rationale**: Avoid frequent rebalancing costs and regime-change whipsaws

**Methodology**:
1. Initial selection: Top 30% by composite factor score (equal-weighted)
2. Hold 1-2 years minimum
3. Rebalance only when fundamentals deteriorate (ROE < 10%, Debt/Equity > 2.0)
4. Minimize transaction costs (0.015% per trade)

**Expected**: Lower Sharpe ratio but better risk-adjusted returns (fewer catastrophic periods)

---

#### C. Equal-Weighted Multi-Factor (No IC Weighting)
**Rationale**: Remove IC estimation error entirely

**Methodology**:
1. Calculate Operating_Profit_Margin, RSI_Momentum, ROE_Proxy scores
2. **Equal weight**: Composite Score = (Factor1 + Factor2 + Factor3) / 3
3. Select top 45% by composite score
4. Rebalance quarterly

**Evidence from Phase 2.3**: Equal-weighted outperformed IC-weighted by 14.1% in Period 2

**Expected**: More stable than IC-weighted, but may still suffer from regime changes (Phase 2.3 showed -8.62% loss)

**Recommendation**: Test on extended period (2021-2024) including Period 1

---

#### D. Machine Learning Factor Combination
**Rationale**: Adapt to regime changes automatically via non-linear models

**Methodology**:
1. **Features**:
   - Factor scores: Operating_Profit_Margin, RSI_Momentum, ROE_Proxy
   - Market regime indicators: VIX, rate changes, macro sentiment
   - Interaction terms: Momentum √ó Value, Quality √ó Size
2. **Model**: XGBoost or RandomForest for non-linear factor interactions
3. **Training**: Rolling window (2 years train, 1 year test)
4. **Target**: 3-month forward return (classification: Top 45% vs Bottom 55%)

**Expected**: Better regime adaptation, but requires extensive validation (overfitting risk)

---

#### E. Abandon Factor-Based Approach Entirely
**Rationale**: Tier 3 factors may be unsuitable for Korean market

**Alternative Strategies**:
- **Pairs Trading**: Cointegration-based statistical arbitrage
- **Statistical Arbitrage**: Mean reversion strategies on sector spreads
- **Momentum Portfolios**: Pure trend-following without fundamental factors
- **Index ETF + Tactical Allocation**: 80% KOSPI ETF + 20% sector rotation

**Expected**: Different risk/return profile, potentially more robust to regime changes

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Systematic Validation**: Extended walk-forward validation caught the catastrophic Period 1 failure
2. **Multi-Phase Approach**: Breaking analysis into phases (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) provided incremental insights
3. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Data-driven decision to abandon IC-weighted approach

### What Didn't Work
1. **IC-Weighted Dynamic Allocation**: Fundamentally unreliable during regime changes
2. **Short Training Windows**: 1-year IC window insufficient for regime transitions
3. **Factor Quality Assumptions**: Assumed factors work consistently across all market conditions

### Key Insights for Future Research
1. **Regime Detection Critical**: Need regime-detection framework BEFORE factor selection
2. **Factor Stability >> Factor Performance**: Favor factors with stable IC over high-but-volatile IC
3. **Long-Term Holdings >> Frequent Rebalancing**: Reduce exposure to regime-change whipsaws
4. **Simpler >> Complex**: Equal-weighted may outperform IC-weighted due to robustness
5. **Multiple Validation Periods Essential**: Never trust results from <3 out-of-sample periods
