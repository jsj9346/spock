## Architecture Pivot Status

### Legacy System (Spock Trading)
- Status: Complete, ready for archival
- Core Files: spock.py, kis_trading_engine.py, init_db.py
- Tests: 6 trading-specific test files
- Documentation: 13+ PHASE5 and KIS_TRADING_ENGINE docs

### New System (Quant Platform)
- Status: Active development, Phase 1 in progress
- Core Files: quant_platform.py, modules/{backtesting,factors,optimization,risk}
- Database: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (db_manager_postgres.py)
- Tests: Comprehensive test infrastructure for quant research

### Reusable Infrastructure (70% Code Reuse)
- Market Adapters: 6 regions (KR, US, CN, HK, JP, VN)
- APIs: KIS, Polygon, yfinance, AkShare
- Data Collection: OHLCV, fundamental, FX data
- Utilities: Kelly calculator, parsers, market calendars

## Recommended Reading Order

### For Project Managers
1. Start: **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md**
2. Then: Review "Key Findings" section
3. Action: Use **FILES_TO_CLEANUP.txt** P0-P1 items

### For Developers
1. Start: **DIRECTORY_ANALYSIS_20251026.md** (full context)
2. Then: Category 1 (Legacy), Category 2 (Active), Category 3 (Reusable)
3. Action: **FILES_TO_CLEANUP.txt** (execution steps)

### For DevOps/Operations
1. Start: **FILES_TO_CLEANUP.txt** (P0-P3 checklist)
2. Then: "Infrastructure" section in DIRECTORY_ANALYSIS
3. Action: Create archive structure and execute cleanup

---

## Next Steps

### Before Any Cleanup (Critical)
```bash
# Run quant platform tests
pytest tests/backtesting/
pytest tests/test_*_factor*.py
pytest tests/test_*_optimization*.py

# Verify quant_platform.py works
python3 quant_platform.py --help

# Check PostgreSQL connection
python3 -c "from modules.db_manager_postgres import PostgreSQLDatabaseManager; print('OK')"
```

### This Week (P1)
- Delete migration_ohlcv.log (192M)
- Delete CLAUDE_backup.md (34K)
- Delete kis_data_collector.py.backup (54K)
- Delete test_cli_login.py (2.8K)

### Week 1-2 (P2)
- Archive trading system files
- Archive trading test files
- Archive trading documentation
- Verify tests pass

### Week 2-3 (P3)
- Archive analysis reports
- Clean old backups
- Archive test reports
- Automate log cleanup (30-day retention)

## Important Notes

### Safety First
- All recommendations are low-risk
- Archive files before deleting (preserve git history)
- Create git tag before cleanup
- Verify quant platform works before deleting anything

### No Data Loss Risk
- All recommendations preserve code in archives
- Active quant platform code remains untouched
- Data remains accessible (can be archived, not deleted)
- Git history preserved via archives

### Automation Opportunities
- Setup automatic log cleanup (>30 days)
- Create backup rotation policy
- Add CI/CD validation for test suite
- Automate analysis report archival
