# ================================================================
# Alert Rule Best Practices
# ================================================================
#
# 1. Alert Fatigue Prevention:
#    - Use appropriate 'for' durations to avoid transient alerts
#    - Set thresholds based on actual impact
#    - Group related alerts
#
# 2. Actionable Alerts:
#    - Always include specific remediation steps
#    - Provide relevant context (thresholds, expected values)
#    - Link to documentation when applicable
#
# 3. Severity Guidelines:
#    - critical: Data loss, complete outage, security breach
#    - warning: Degraded performance, approaching limits
#    - info: Awareness, trends, non-critical state changes
#
# 4. Alert Routing (configured in Alertmanager):
#    - critical → Page/SMS + Email
#    - warning → Email
#    - info → Dashboard notification only
#
# 5. Testing Alert Rules:
#    amtool check-config alert_rules.yaml
#    promtool check rules alert_rules.yaml
