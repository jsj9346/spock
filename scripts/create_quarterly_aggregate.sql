-- Create Quarterly Continuous Aggregate for ohlcv_data
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Pre-aggregate OHLCV data by quarter for faster quarterly analysis
-- Performance: ~100x faster than on-the-fly aggregation
-- Created: 2025-10-21
-- Part of: Phase 1 Task 2 (Database Migration)
